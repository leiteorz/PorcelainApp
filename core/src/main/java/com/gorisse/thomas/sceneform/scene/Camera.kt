 * ### Computes the camera's EV100 from exposure settings

 * Exposure value (EV) is a number that represents a combination of a camera's shutter speed and
 * f-number, such that all combinations that yield the same exposure have the same EV
 * (for any fixed scene luminance)

/**
 * ### Computes the exposure normalization factor from the camera's EV100
 *
 * Calculate a unit-less intensity scale from the actual Filament camera settings
 *
 * This method is useful when trying to match the lighting of other engines or tools.
 * Many engines/tools use unit-less light intensities, which can be matched by setting
 * the exposure manually.
 *
 * Filament uses a physically based camera model, with aperture, shutter speed, and sensitivity
 * (ISO).
 * This plays nicely with physical light units (for instance if you measure the sun outside on a
 * sunny day in California you'll get ~110,000 lux and if you set your camera settings to
 * Æ’/16 1/125s ISO 100, exposure will be correct). However many engines use "relative exposure"
 * instead, where exposure is just a float and set to 1.0 by default.
 *
 * ARCore's light estimation was designed to work with those engines.
 * So we scale light intensities estimations by multiplying the values provided by ARCore
 * by 1.0 / log2((aperture * aperture) / shutterSpeed * 100.0f / sensitivity).
 * This should raise ARCore's values to something that's physically plausible for the chosen
 * exposure.
